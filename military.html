                <h2></h2>
                <p>Staff Sergeant JEffERY SAlAZAR provided mission critical airpower expertise as a 
                    joint terminal attack controller (JTAC) while attached to an Army Special Forces 
                    team in the contested Konar Province, Afghanistan from January to July 2011. As the 
                    sole JTAC on the team, he planned, coordinated, and executed air support for 37 
                    combat missions. He also controlled “danger- close” fixed and rotary wing airstrikes 
                    in 15 high-intensity combat engagements with the enemy.<br> 
                    <br>

                    On one combat reconnaissance patrol, Sergeant Salazar and his team split into two 
                    maneuver elements to conduct the operation. Within minutes of splitting, Sergeant 
                    Salazar’s sister element received enemy fire. As Sergeant Salazar and his element 
                    maneuvered into a support-by-fire position, they also began receiving small arms 
                    fire from four Taliban fighters. Sergeant Salazar quickly engaged two of the four 
                    insurgents with his machine gun. As they pursued the enemy fighters on foot, his 
                    element continued to be targeted with sporadic enemy fire. Sergeant Salazar moved 
                    within 10 meters of one enemy position where he positively identified and engaged 
                    an enemy fighter with his rifle. Suspecting that the enemy was killed, he then 
                    shifted his focus to the other enemy fighters, moving closer to confirm that the 
                    first enemy fighter was killed. When he was within 15 feet of the presumed dead 
                    Taliban fighter, the enemy fighter threw a hand grenade at Sergeant Salazar. Although 
                    it landed short, the grenade was still within fragmentation range. Sergeant Salazar 
                    was blown off his feet but rapidly regained his composure and reengaged the enemy 
                    with his rifle and killed his adversary. Even though the grenade inflicted fragmentation 
                    injuries to his knee, Sergeant Salazar fought through the pain during the four-hour 
                    engagement until the mission was complete.<br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    At the beginning of the engagement, Sergeant Salazar had requested close air support 
                    and subsequently received a flight of two F-16s. After the F-16s checked in, the other 
                    element was hit by an improvised explosive device. Sergeant Salazar and his element 
                    moved to their location to provide treatment to the injured. He then used the aircraft 
                    as an early warning device for any enemy activity to paint a picture of the battlefield 
                    for the ground force commander and to aid with the medical evacuation.<br> 
                    <br>
                    
                    Using 17,000 pounds of bombs and an assortment of rockets and guns, Sergeant Salazar’s 
                    actions over the course of his deployment resulted in 38 enemies killed in action. For 
                    his heroic actions, Sergeant Salazar was awarded the Bronze Star.<br>
